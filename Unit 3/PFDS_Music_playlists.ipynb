    "Working with data that involves dates and times can often be difficult, in part because of the different ways that times and dates can be represented (e.g. the order in which days and months are displayed) and because times and dates are different in different places. The source of a lot of problems with dates and times is the fact that there are not an integer number of days in a year and the length of the year changes slightly each year. So if you ever have to work with data that involves dates and times, take extra care, consider possible issues with the data (such as whether it is formated in a consistent way) and check everything you do very carefully."
