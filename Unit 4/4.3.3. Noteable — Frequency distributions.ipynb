    "# Frequency distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental forms of analysis is to look at\n",
    "the distribution of values of some quantitative property in relation\n",
    "to a set of data samples. One may then try to form an explanation\n",
    "of why the values are distributed in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mathematical point of view, one can describe a frequency\n",
    "distribution in terms of some mathematical function. Many techniques\n",
    "have been developed for finding functions that fit a given set of\n",
    "values or for determining how closely a function fits a set of\n",
    "values. However, there is an infinite variety of possible functions,\n",
    "and it is always possible to construct a function that will exactly\n",
    "fit any frequency distribution.\n",
    "Hence, one is usually looking for kinds of function that give some explanation of why the frequency distribution occurs. Typically one wants to find a function for\n",
    "which there is a statistical and/or physical basis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an uniformly distributed random variable, such as the roll of a dice\n",
    "  or the selection of winning numbers in a lottery;\n",
    "* a Gausian distribution, which can come from the cumulative result of many underlying\n",
    "  random factors;\n",
    "* the result of an iterative process, consisting of steps that\n",
    "  have a random outcome (which might be modelled as a\n",
    "  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain\">Markov Chain</a>\n",
    "  or a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function\">survival function</a>);\n",
    "* a function depending on some spatial or physical property\n",
    "  (e.g. proximity to a radiation source).\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, a frequency distribution may result from a\n",
    "combination of several different factors, and thus explanation\n",
    "may require a complex model incorporating several types\n",
    "of function.\n",

    "The kinds of analysis just mentioned go well beyond the scope of\n",

    "data and construct a model for its frequency distribution, instead we shall\n",
    "go the other way round: we will use Python both\n",
    "to generate and to visualise various types of random function.\n",
    "This will give you some insight into what kinds of frequency\n",
    "distribution might give rise to the data that you encounter, and hence\n",
    "guide you towards its analysis. It will also illustrate a number\n",
