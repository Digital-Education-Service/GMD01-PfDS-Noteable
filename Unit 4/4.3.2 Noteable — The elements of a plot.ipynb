    "This is just an alternative way of plotting the same thing, both approaches are valid.\n",

    "The first line of code created a figure and Axes because none existed already, the second line added to that Axes.\n",
    "There is a method in pyplot to get the current Axes, `gca()` (similarly `gcf()` gets the current figure).\n",
    "When calling `plt.plot()` pyplot essentially uses `gca()` to get the current Axes and then calls the Axes method `plot()` on this.\n",

    "Overall, the object oriented style used throughout this lesson gives clarity about which object is being modified by any line of code, and allows for an easier transition from very simple to more complicated plots.\n",
    "The reason for mentioning the alternative style is that you may prefer it for simple tasks and many examples on the web use this style.\n",
    "Working through examples from online resources is an excellent way to practise and develop what you've learned, being aware of these two different ways of using matplotlib will hopefully mean you're not confused if an example uses the other approach.\n",

    "There is one other way of using matplotlib, which is to import pylab.\n",
    "Pylab is a module that includes matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and other useful functions, all within a single namespace.\n",
    "Its purpose was to allow easy access to a variety of functionality in a single place but using pylab is now generally discouraged because importing so much functionality into the global namespace can result in unexpected behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as a current figure there may be other figures in memory.\n",
    "At the start of the lesson we said that `plt.show()` displays all open figures.\n",
    "To see which figures are open use the pyplot function `get_fignums()`.\n",
    "The function `close()` will close the current figure if called without arguments, or you can pass in a figure number, or 'all' to close all the open figures.\n",
    "This can be useful for managing memory.\n"
