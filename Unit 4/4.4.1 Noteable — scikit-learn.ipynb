    "The scikit-learn package contains a broad range of open source computational tools for data science and predictive analytics. The scikit-learn package is built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib and includes functions and methods for classification, regression, clustering, neural networks and data transformations, as well as many other forms of stistical machine learning. Rather than try to cover lots of different tools, we will focus on a simple example and try to demonstrate how you can go about learning how to use the tools in scikit-learn independently.\n",

    "The scikit-learn package has good documentation, which includes descriptions of the statistics as well as examples of code. In this notebook, we will look at how to fit a regression model to data using the [Linear Regression Example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html). In linear regression, the response variable (or target value) is assumed to be a linear combination of the explanatory variables (features) plus random, normally distributed noise. If there is only one explanatory variable, then we are trying to fit a straight line to data.\n",

    "In this figure we can see the training data in light gray markers, as well as the testing data in black markers. The blue line indicates the linear model fit and the red lines indicate the errors (i.e. the difference between the data and the predicted values along the line of best fit). The explanatory variable is body mass index (BMI), and the unscaled values have been plotted. It's not clear exactly what the target variable is, but the reference paper refers to this as \"a measure of disease propagation one year after baseline\".\n",
    "\n",
    "From this figure it should be clear that we might use our linear regression to ask whether BMI could be used to predict disease propagation. The results suggest that BMI is positively correlated with the measure of disease propagation, but the relatively small $R^2$ value suggests that BMI alone is not a strong predictor of disease propagation. In this figure we can see more clearly that the testing data does not represent the variation seen in the training data, and hence why the mean squared error was relatively small."
