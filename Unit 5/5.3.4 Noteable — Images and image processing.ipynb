    "Although _colour_ is not a property that is often investigated in data, consideration of the concept of colour can be very instructive for a data scientist. This is because, although colour may appear to be a simple and intuitive type of data, the nature of colour is extremely complex. To understand it fully one would need to consider\n",

    "One thing we may know is that gray scale images can be represented\n",
    "by just one number representing the brightness of each pixel.\n",
    "However, in a red, green, blue (or blue, green, red) representation\n",

    "values. Is this true? If so why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, actually it is true, but the reason is not simple.\n",
