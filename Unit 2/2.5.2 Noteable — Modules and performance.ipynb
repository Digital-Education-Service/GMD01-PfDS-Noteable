    "A module is usually a collection of related functions and objects that you might want to use in multiple different Python projects. For example, in the first unit, we used the `math` module. A Python package or library is a collection of modules that might be structured in some way, and this course will introduce you to several different packages (such as NumPy, pandas and matplotlib). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily create your own modules by saving your functions in a file with the extension `.py`, which can then be imported into your notebook like any other module or package, provided they are saved in the same place as where you want to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's use the functions created in the Functions lesson, which were `isItChristmas`, `countLetters`, and (in the exercises) `long_words_after_l`. These have been saved in a file called `my_functions.py` in the same directory as this notebook. We can then import them as we would any other package:"

    "There are often many ways to write a program in Python, and one way to help you to decide which approach you should use is by testing the performance of each approach. The key factors in a program's performance are speed (how long it takes to run) and how much memory it uses. Often we may want to scale up our programs to larger data sets, or to run them over more cases, in which case it's also important to know how speed and memory scale with the size of the inputs. In this section we'll describe some basic aspects of timing bits of code.\n",

    "To test the speed of a program, we need to time it, and there are several packages that allow us to time code. First we will look at a way to time Python code that you can use in any IDE, and then we will look at some Jupyter Notebook specific commands that allow us to do this.\n",

Your computer is likely to have many jobs that it needs to run, and so the time it takes to run your function may depend on what other processes are running in the background and also what time is measured. The CPU time is how much time was spent actually running your code on the computer, whereas the wall time is how much time between elapsed between you starting to run the code and getting the output (so includes the time taken waiting for any other processes to finish). Note that the output may be measured in nano seconds ($10^{-9}$ seconds, indicated by an `n`), microseconds ($10^{-6}$ seconds, indicated by a $\\mu$), milliseconds ($10^{-3}$ seconds, indicated by an `m`) etc.\n",

In the single loop case, the computational time scales (roughly) *linearly*, i.e. in propotion to the input size. In the double loop case, the computational time scales (roughly) *quadratically*, i.e. like the square of the input size. This was fairly evident in these simple examples, because it was clear how many operations were being performed in each case and how that depended on the input. However, it may be much less clear in more complicated programs and algorithms, particularly when functions from other packages are used, where it's not exactly clear how they work. \n",
